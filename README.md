# A. Duck Keyboard

Based off the excellent [Architeuthis dux keyboard](https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux), the goal is to add a third thumb key and see where else this takes me.

Built with [Ergogen](https://github.com/mrzealot/ergogen).

### To Run Locally

Due to an issue with libraries to generate, run `npm install` in the base directory, then run `npm install` in the `./node_modules/kle-serial` folder.
